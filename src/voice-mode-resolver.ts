// Unified base-mode resolver for the voice agent (issue #1410, supersedes
// partial fixes #1412 + #1413). Reads the independent mode-state substrates
// once per call and returns a canonical mode descriptor.
//
// Multi-substrate state divergence is the root cause of the
// `[System: Produce ZERO audio. Call NO tools.]` fabrication tokens that
// gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview emits as spoken output at session connect.
// Without an explicit base-mode declaration, the model infers meeting-mode
// silence from co-present-flavored context.
//
// Substrate inventory + read/write contract:
//   1. `meetingActive` (in-memory, voice-agent.ts) — READ here, source of
//      truth for the meeting/active axis. Mutated by switch_mode, by
//      applyModeRequest poll, and by Zoom auto-detect at startup.
//   2. presenter HTTP server `:7877/presenter` — READ here, source of truth
//      for the presenter axis (independent from meeting/active).
//   3. `voice-mode.txt` on disk — NOT READ here. It is the WRITE-ONLY
//      output mirror of `meetingActive`, written by writeVoiceModeSentinel()
//      whenever meetingActive changes. Downstream consumers (web-client,
//      Sutando.app menu-bar, discord-voice-server) read it. Reading it here
//      would re-read our own output — same source as #1, one hop later.
//   4. `activeMode` in skills/screen-companion/tools.ts — NOT READ here.
//      Orthogonal sub-mode that overlays the base; not a base mode itself.
//      Base axis is {active, meeting, presenter}; sub-mode axis is
//      {none, guided-setup, pair-debug, ...}. Conflating the two would
//      lose information.
//
// This module is pure (no side effects on import) so it can be unit-tested
// without booting the voice agent.
