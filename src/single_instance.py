"""Single-instance guard for long-running bridge daemons.

Prevents two copies of the same bridge running simultaneously — a real
failure mode when startup.sh and Sutando.app's launchd agent race at boot
(observed 2026-05-xx: duplicate telegram-bridge caused API 409 errors;
duplicate discord-bridge caused double task delivery).

Usage (at the top of a bridge's main entry point):

    from single_instance import acquire
    acquire("telegram-bridge")   # or "discord-bridge" / "slack-bridge"

The lock is an OS-level exclusive non-blocking lock on a file in
`$WORKSPACE/state/locks/<name>.lock` — `fcntl.flock` on POSIX, the
equivalent `msvcrt.locking` byte-range lock on Windows. It auto-releases
on process death (OS closes all FDs), so no explicit cleanup is needed.
The FD is kept in `_held_fds` to prevent CPython's GC from closing it early.

Exit behavior: exits 0 (not 1) on lock contention so launchd's KeepAlive
doesn't restart-loop when it's simply the second instance.
