"""Archive stale `results/*.txt` files to `results/archive-YYYY-MM-DD/`.

Run once at system startup (before any service begins iterating `results/`)
so that task-bridge, discord-bridge, and the DM-fallback path never have to
reason about long-dead files they weren't around to consume.

Retention policy: by default, any `.txt` directly under `results/` whose
mtime is older than $RETENTION_HOURS (default 24) gets moved under a
date-stamped archive subdirectory. Files inside existing `archive-*`
subdirectories are never touched.

Usage:
    python3 src/archive-stale-results.py
    RETENTION_HOURS=48 python3 src/archive-stale-results.py      # looser window
    DRY_RUN=1 python3 src/archive-stale-results.py               # print, don't move

Intended caller: `src/startup.sh` runs this before launching services.

Why this exists: on 2026-04-15 the DM fallback wiring iterated `results/`
on voice-agent restart, found 142 stale files accumulated since the prior
day, and fired one DM per file. The flood was stopped by a manual archive
sweep of the same directory. This script automates that sweep and runs it
before services can see the backlog. Full post-mortem:
`notes/post-mortem-dm-flood-2026-04-15.md`.
