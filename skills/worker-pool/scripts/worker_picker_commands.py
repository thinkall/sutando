"""The worker picker's buttons arrive as ordinary tasks; this reads their intent.

The broker turns each button into a normal task addressed to this instance —
`source: worker-picker`, an id prefixed `worker-add-` or `worker-pin-`, and a
sentence of English. So the intent has to be recovered, and two rules keep that
honest:

  * the ROOM comes from the `channel_id` header, never from the sentence —
    a room-scoped button with no stamped room is REFUSED, not guessed;
  * `source` must be the header the gateway stamped — prose that merely says
    "worker picker" grants nothing, or anyone who can send a message could
    create workers.

Both rules rest on one mechanism: the parser is chosen by WRITER, not by any
value in the file. A task-last file is read STRICTLY — parsing stops at `task:`,
so a body cannot supply a header. The remote-gateway bridge is the one writer
that puts fields below `task:`; it newline-strips every value, which is what
makes its last-wins scan safe, and a verified envelope HMAC is what admits it,
which is how it is RECOGNISED rather than inferred from a header it also writes.
Sniffing the writer from a value is the forgery these rules exist to prevent:
a body line `access_tier: owner` under a last-wins scan is an authorization
bypass, not a typo. The producer side of the bargain: a task-last writer must
put `source` and `channel_id` ABOVE `task:`, or this reader refuses.

It returns intent. Acting on one is the caller's, so a misparse cannot spawn.
