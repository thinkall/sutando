description: File a bug report, feature request, or feedback about Sutando to the team from any surface (chat, Discord, Telegram, or a voice-delegated task) — or automatically (--auto) when the agent itself hits a Sutando/AG2 Space bug. Reuses the cloud /api/feedback API and auto-attaches diagnostic context. Use when the user says "report a bug", "something's broken, file it", "I have a feature request", etc.

# Report Feedback

When the user asks to **report a bug / issue / feature request / feedback about Sutando itself** — e.g. "report a bug", "something's broken, file it", "I have a feature request" — use this skill to file it.

It posts to the cloud `/api/feedback` route (the same one the desktop "Report an issue" form uses, which mirrors into GitHub issues) and auto-attaches diagnostic context (platform + a tail of recent workspace logs), so you don't need to gather logs yourself.

This is the **single reporting path for all surfaces** — chat, Discord, Telegram, and voice (which reaches it by delegating the task to the core agent). There is intentionally no separate voice tool, to avoid duplicating the same capability.

## Usage

```bash
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py \
  --title "<short one-line summary>" \
  [--body "<what happened, steps to reproduce, what was expected>"] \
  [--kind bug|feature|other] \
  [--severity low|medium|high|critical] \
  [--no-logs] [--auto]
```

- Ask the user for a short **title** and a **description** if they're not already clear from the conversation. Infer `kind` (default `bug`) and `severity` (default `medium`) from context.
- **Announce the log attachment before sending, then honor an opt-out.** Recent diagnostic logs are attached by default. Since there's no visible checkbox on voice/chat (unlike the desktop form), *say so first* — e.g. "I'll attach recent diagnostic logs to help debug, unless you'd rather I didn't." If the user declines, pass `--no-logs`. This makes it an informed opt-out rather than a silent default (especially important on voice, where the user can't see what's being sent). Log excerpts are redaction-scrubbed (Bearer tokens, `token=`/`api_key=`/`secret=` values, common key formats, and the home-dir username are masked) as a backstop, but announcing is still required.

## Ask first (`--ask`, or `askFirst` in the owner's prefs)

The owner's approval step for automatic reports. Instead of filing, the report is parked as a draft under
`<workspace>/state/feedback-drafts/<id>.json` and registered in the engine's HITL store (`src/hitl`) as a
`HumanRequirement`: the gateway bridge projects it as the owner's card — **File this bug report · File
without logs · Skip** — into its proactive room, and applies the click with the same stale-revision guard
every other card gets. Nothing is posted by this script, so it needs no gateway env.

```bash
# ask (also what --auto does when feedback-prefs.json has "askFirst": true):
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --auto --title "..." --body "..."
# after the owner answers (the click is durable in the HITL store): run the clicked choices
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --apply
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --drafts        # pending drafts, oldest first
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --decide <draft-id> file|file_no_logs|skip   # by hand
```

- The click is applied **automatically, in the turn it causes**: the requirement is created with
  `turn_on_action`, so the bridge records the click and then lets the same relay task through to the
  core (and re-forwards it if the relay redelivers the same click before that task was written, so a
  death in between cannot lose the turn); that task carries the header `hitl_click: true` and the card
  label as its body — it is a click
  already recorded, not an instruction: answer `[no-send]`, do not file by hand, and let the turn end —
  and the skill's `Stop` hook (`manifest.json` → `hooks/apply-clicks.py`, registered by
  `bash src/install-claude-hooks.sh` like every skill hook) runs `apply_clicks()` as that turn ends.
  `--apply` is the same routine by hand. It also registers any parked draft whose card was never created
  (a store write that failed at ask time exits 3 and keeps the draft).
- Filing is exactly-once by markers: before the post the draft becomes `<id>.posting`; a 2xx renames it
  to `<id>.filed`, the card is resolved, the receipt removed; a 4xx (the server refused, nothing written)
  renames it back to a draft. A 5xx proves nothing (the write may have committed), so like no answer at
  all (a transport error, a death mid-request) it leaves `<id>.posting`, and
  `--apply` **holds** it — never re-posted on a guess. A held draft is owner-visible: the answered card
  closes and a new card asks "Bug report: filed or not? — File it again / Skip"; its click runs through
  the same path (`file` re-posts on purpose, `skip` drops the in-flight draft). `--drafts` lists parked
  drafts; in-flight ones are visible to `list_drafts(ws, state="posting")`, and `--decide <id> file|skip`
  settles one by hand and closes its cards. The payload carries `context.idempotency_key = <draft id>`
  for a server-side check.
- `file` attaches logs only if `sendLogs` is on; `file_no_logs` never does; `skip` drops the draft.
  Logs are gathered only after the choice — the card carries the title only.
- The ask is the throttled event: dedupe and the daily cap are checked and **recorded** when the card
  is asked, and the off-switch applies to `--ask` as well as `--auto`.
- Draft ids are `fb_` + 10 lowercase hex; anything else is refused before any read or unlink.

## Automatic reports (`--auto`)

When **you** (not the user) determine that a bug or error is caused by Sutando itself or AG2 Space — engine services, bridges, the desktop app, AG2 Space connectivity, or the AG2 cloud — queue it with `--auto`. Never `--auto`-file problems in the user's own projects or code, third-party tools/sites/APIs, or expected failures (bad input, credentials the owner simply hasn't provided).

`--auto` enforces the owner's Settings toggles (read from `<workspace>/state/feedback-prefs.json`, written by the desktop app). When the file is absent the two defaults differ:

- **File automatic bug reports** — defaults **ON**. Off → the script prints `SKIPPED` and exits 3. Respect it — do not retry or route around it.
- **Send logs with bug reports** — defaults **OFF**, i.e. opt-in. Off → the log excerpt is omitted from every report (auto and manual), same as `--no-logs`.

The split is deliberate. Absence of the file must not disable reporting on installs that predate the toggles, but absence is not consent either, and the log excerpt is the part that carries incidental owner data — paths containing usernames, hostnames, workspace content. An owner who has never opened Settings ships no logs.

Auto reports are also deduped (an identical title within 24h) and rate-limited (5 per 24h) via `<workspace>/state/feedback-auto-reports.json`. A `SKIPPED` exit (3) is a normal outcome, not an error — just move on. Only after `OK: filed` (not `HELD`), tell the owner in one short sentence (e.g. "I've filed a bug report about this"); the Settings toggle is the consent surface, so don't ask permission first.

## Hold automatic reports while existing recovery runs

`--auto` first returns `HELD: incident fb_…`. The report stays locally in
`state/feedback-drafts/`; it sends nothing and creates no approval card yet.
An identical pending title reuses its incident ID and original deadline.
Manual reports without `--auto` remain immediate.

Use the returned incident ID to record the **existing** recovery lifecycle:

```bash
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --auto --title "Bridge disconnected" --body "Observed failure"
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --recovery fb_0123456789 started
# After the existing recovery finishes, record exactly one outcome:
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --recovery fb_0123456789 succeeded
# Or, only when recovery has definitively failed / exhausted its own timeout:
python3 skills/report-feedback/report-feedback.py --recovery fb_0123456789 failed
```

- Record `started` as soon as an existing recovery begins (or immediately after
  queuing if it is already running). **Do not start extra recovery to satisfy reporting.**
- Record `succeeded` only when the original failing operation is verified working.
  Restarting a process alone is insufficient. Success archives the local diagnostic
  draft as `.suppressed` and cancels any unsent approval card.
- Record `failed` only for the final outcome, not an intermediate failed retry.
  This immediately releases the report through the current preferences, daily cap,
  deduplication and ask-first flow. An already-failed recovery can be recorded
  immediately after queuing; no new attempt is required.
- If recovery never starts, the report becomes eligible one hour after queuing.
  If recovery is still running at that deadline, it remains held. The existing
  recovery controller/agent must report its final failure, including its own timeout.
  This skill never infers success or failure from unrelated health checks.
- Keep the incident ID with the task's recovery context across turns. Record outcomes
  for that incident only. Repeat detections do not extend the one-hour deadline.
- `--drafts` lists pending incidents and their recovery state. `--apply` evaluates
  deadlines and applies owner clicks. Reports carry `context.recovery` with the state,
  deadline and release reason. Automatic posting never claims owner approval.
- The auto-report off-switch is checked again at release; disabled queued reports
  are archived and do not return when the switch is re-enabled. Logs are collected
  only at filing, using current `sendLogs` and the queued `--no-logs` choice.

### Deadline worker (deployment)

The Stop hook applies owner clicks without waiting behind a worker; automatic
releases run in the worker or explicit CLI. **Install the periodic worker when deploying this change on macOS:**

```bash
python3 skills/report-feedback/install-worker.py
# Inspect the job without installing:
python3 skills/report-feedback/install-worker.py --render
# Remove the worker:
python3 skills/report-feedback/install-worker.py --uninstall
```

It runs `report-feedback.py --apply` every 60 seconds via launchd and at login,
independent of the core. Deadlines persist across restarts and are evaluated on the
next tick after wake/login; an offline/asleep machine cannot submit at an exact
wall-clock deadline. Use a persistent checkout and Python installation; reinstall
if either path changes. Inspect `logs/feedback-recovery.log` for worker errors.
On other platforms, configure the OS scheduler to run the same `--apply` command
once per minute. Without a periodic worker, deadlines are checked only on an explicit `--apply`
or recovery update; installing the code alone does not activate the timer.

Posts use the existing draft `.posting`/`.filed` receipts: uncertain network outcomes
are held for the existing owner decision card, never automatically reposted. CLI,
Stop hook and worker serialize mutations with `state/feedback-reports.lock`.

## Behavior

- Requires the user to be **signed in to Sutando Cloud** (Settings → Sutando Cloud). If not, the script prints `NOT_SIGNED_IN` and exits 2 — relay that and ask them to sign in, then retry. For `--auto` reports, don't nag: mention it at most once.
- On success it prints `OK: filed <kind> report`. On API error it prints `ERROR: …` — relay a brief apology and offer to retry.
- Exit codes: `0` filed, held, recovery recorded, or applied (read the output), `1` error, `2` not signed in, `3` skipped (auto reports disabled, duplicate, or rate-limited).

## Access tier

**Owner-tier only** — it files under the owner's Sutando Cloud identity, and it reads the owner's cloud token + attaches the owner's workspace log tail. Do not run it for non-owner (team/other) Discord, Slack, or Telegram tiers.

Non-owner tasks never reach this skill: the bridges route team/other tiers to a sandboxed `codex exec --sandbox read-only` agent (see CLAUDE.md access-control), which has no cloud token and cannot execute this script — so a non-owner can't ship the owner's logs into an issue. Only `access_tier: owner` (or an unauthenticated local/voice owner task) is processed with full capabilities that can invoke this skill.
