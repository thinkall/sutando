"""Structural cross-check that `_poll_proactive` in `src/discord-bridge.py`
honors `[channel: <id>]` redirect markers with the "fail loudly, succeed
quietly" semantic (owner-greenlit 2026-05-26 DM thread).

Why structural and not behavioral: behavioral testing of `_poll_proactive`
requires async discord.py + a mocked client + mocked channel + mocked DM.
That setup has more LOC than the fix itself. The structural test catches
the regressions we actually care about — "did someone delete the redirect
branch" / "did someone start stripping the marker on the failure path
(restoring the silent-failure mode this commit fixed)" — at near-zero cost.

Guards:
  1. `_poll_proactive` parses `[channel:]` markers before DM-send
  2. On successful target-channel send, marker is stripped AND `continue`s
     past the DM-send (quiet success)
  3. On failure paths (channel unresolved / send exception), the literal
     marker is NOT stripped from `clean_text` and falls through to DM —
     i.e. NO `re.sub` between the failure print and the DM send (loud
     failure: operator sees the leaked marker as the signal)

Run: python3 tests/proactive-channel-redirect-loud-failure.test.py
Exit: 0 on pass, 1 on fail.
