# Sutando task watcher for Windows - PowerShell twin of src/watch-tasks-stream.sh.
#
# Watches $SUTANDO_WORKSPACE/tasks/ and emits "TASK_FILE: <name>" per new file
# to STDOUT, line-buffered, so the core Claude Code session can stream it via
# Bash(run_in_background: true) + TaskOutput.
#
# Implementation note: a previous version used Register-ObjectEvent + an
# -Action script block. That fires in a separate runspace - Write-Output from
# inside the action lands in that runspace's output stream, not the parent
# script's stdout, so the core agent never saw any events. This version uses
# WaitForChanged in a foreground loop instead, which keeps emissions on the
# script's own stdout pipeline.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File src/watch-tasks-stream.ps1

# Force unbuffered stdout. Without this, lines can sit in the .NET output
# buffer for seconds, which defeats the whole "streaming" point.
