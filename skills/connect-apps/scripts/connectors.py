  rearm                             restart the waiter of every unclaimed wait that has none

Output is one JSON object on stdout. Exit codes: 0 ok; 1 a negative answer (no
exact match, not every app connected, nothing claimed, the account not the
wait's or unknown); 2 a setup problem to relay, not retry (not signed in,
connectors disabled, unknown app, too many apps, bad arguments, not the owner's
own AG2 Space task, cloud unreachable).

A wait is `<workspace>/state/connect-waits/<wait-id>.json`. Claiming it is a
rename to `<wait-id>.claimed`, so exactly one of the waiter, the deadline,
`claim` and a superseding `await` wins, and only the winner acts. The claimed
record keeps who claimed it and when, so `claim` and `status` can report that a
room's request is already answered or being answered. The waiter writes one
resume task, `tasks/task-connect-<wait-id>.txt`, which the core processes like
any other. Only a live owner-tier AG2 Space task can record a wait, and one task
has at most one wait per room. A wait whose AG2 Cloud account is unknown never
answers with data (outcome `unverified`), and waits of different accounts are
never merged; a `connected` resume runs `verify-account` and `claim` reports each
wait's account verdict, because the account signed in, or the one the running
core's station was started for, may no longer be the wait's.

A private card is the owner-only face of a wait asked from a room with other
people: one record in `<workspace>/state/connect-cards.json`, which the desktop
client reads over the engine's loopback media route and draws inside the "Only
visible to you" card under message `reply_to`. It never becomes a Matrix event,
so no other member of the room receives it. The record carries the apps, the
lines the agent says about connecting and the wait's status; never the request.

A switch wait (`await --switch`) is the owner moving an app to another account.
Every sign-in makes a new connection row in the cloud, so the wait records, at
arm time and before any card exists, the ids of the app's active connections
(`marker["switch"]`), and it is ready only once every app has an active
connection that is not one of those. An owner who says "done" before switching
is told it is not switched yet, never answered with the old account. A switch
wait is never merged with a plain one: each kind's resume says something else.

`<workspace>/state/connect-cache.json` keeps the last connections read and the
last catalog lookups for CACHE_TTL_S. Only the read commands (`find`, `status`,
`card`) and the connect-apps precheck hook read it: a card drawn from a
30-second-old view is right often enough, and it saves a round trip per turn.
`claim`, `verify-account`, the waiter and the `--switch` baseline never do:
each of those decides whether an owner's request runs against an account, so
each reads the cloud itself.
