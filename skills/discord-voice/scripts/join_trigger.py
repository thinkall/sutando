discord-voice join-trigger helper — the "magic word" summon.

The discord-bridge (`src/discord-bridge.py`) is core infrastructure and must
stay thin (CLAUDE.md "Architecture rules"). So the bridge only does the cheap
detection — "is this the owner + does the trimmed message match the join
phrase" — via `message_is_join_phrase()`, and then hands the whole join off
to `handle_join_trigger()` here. All the feature logic lives in this skill:

  - resolve the join phrase from the discord-voice config
  - look up which voice channel the owner is currently in
  - guard against double-launching a server already running for that channel
  - spawn `discord-voice-server.ts` as a detached background subprocess

Pure-ish + import-light so the bridge can import it without pulling in
discord.py-only machinery; the only discord.py touch is reading attributes
off the message object the bridge already has.
