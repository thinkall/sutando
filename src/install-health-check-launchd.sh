# Install / uninstall the launchd-supervised health-check FALLBACK job.
#
# Role: OS-level safety net for "all of Sutando is dead." Sutando.app's
# in-process Timer (PR #613) is the primary 30min health-check while the
# menu-bar app is alive. This job is the redundant supervisor that keeps
# running even when Sutando.app exits / crashes / signs out — closing the
# circular-dependency gap that motivated PR #616.
#
# What this does:
#   - Renders src/launchd/com.sutando.health-check-fallback.plist with
#     absolute paths and writes it to
#     ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sutando.health-check-fallback.plist
#   - Loads it via `launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID` (the modern Sequoia idiom).
#   - Result: macOS runs `python3 src/health-check.py --emit-task
#     --notify-on-fail --quiet` every 5min, independent of any other Sutando
#     process. Failures surface as tasks (for the agent to act on) AND as
#     macOS notifications (so the human sees them even if all of Sutando is
#     dead).
#
# What the user sees first time they install:
#   - One macOS "Background Item Added" notification banner (Apple's own UX,
#     not Sutando's). Dismissable.
#   - A new "Sutando — Health Check" entry in System Settings → General →
#     Login Items → "Allow in the Background" with a toggle. Disable any
#     time without breaking Sutando.
#
# Strictly opt-in: not called by startup.sh. Run this script when you want
# OS-supervised health detection.
#
# Usage:
#   bash src/install-health-check-launchd.sh             # install (idempotent)
#   bash src/install-health-check-launchd.sh --uninstall # remove (idempotent)
#   bash src/install-health-check-launchd.sh --status    # print job state
#
# Idempotent: re-running install bootouts the existing job before
# bootstrapping the new one, so a `git pull` that updates the template is
# picked up by re-running this script.
