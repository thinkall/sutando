# restart-voice-agent.sh — kickstart com.sutando.voice-agent and verify the
# restart actually happened. Exists because `launchctl kickstart -k` is known
# to silently no-op (observed 2026-04-25, 9.5h of stale code mid-talk-prep).
#
# Verification:
#   1. Capture LISTEN PID on :9900 BEFORE kickstart (filters out connected
#      WebSocket clients that would otherwise pick up a non-listener PID).
#   2. `launchctl kickstart -k gui/<uid>/com.sutando.voice-agent`.
#   3. Poll up to MAX_DEADLINE_SECONDS for a fresh LISTEN PID. Don't fix-sleep
#      because cold tsx boots take variable time.
#   4. Accept the restart only when (etime <= MAX_ETIME_SECONDS), regardless
#      of whether NEW_PID matches OLD_PID — rare PID reuse + a fresh process
#      is still a successful restart, not a silent no-op.
#   5. Reject when (no listener appeared by the deadline) OR (NEW_PID == OLD_PID
#      AND etime > MAX_ETIME_SECONDS) — that's the silent-no-op signature.
#
# Exits 0 only when all checks pass. Non-zero with a one-line diagnostic
# pointing at which assertion failed.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/restart-voice-agent.sh
