"""Unit tests for `_resolve_proactive_owner_id` in src/telegram-bridge.py.

The pre-fix code resolved the proactive-DM recipient via
`next(iter(load_allowed()))`. `load_allowed()` returns a `set`, so the
iteration order was hash-slot order, not list order. With a single
user in `allowFrom` (the common case) this happened to work; with
multiple users — e.g. after `/telegram:access allow` added a second
sender — it could route owner-notifications to the wrong human, the
same bug class that hits discord-bridge's poll_proactive when its
ad-hoc resolver iterates a set instead of the allowFrom list.

The fix extracts the resolution into `_resolve_proactive_owner_id`, a
pure function with a documented priority chain:

  1. $SUTANDO_DM_OWNER_ID env override.
  2. tierMap[uid] == "owner" — explicit admin tier signal.
  3. tofuOwner — first-install record from `tofu_onboard`. Only
     honored if still present in allowFrom (removed → admin opt-out).
  4. First entry in allowFrom IN LIST ORDER (not set order).

This file pins every branch of that chain.
