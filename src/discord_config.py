"""
Workspace-local Sutando-specific Discord configuration (closes #1147).

The official discord plugin owns `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/discord/access.json` with
its documented schema (`dmPolicy`, `allowFrom`, `groups`, `pending`). Sutando
has been squatting on that file for its own fields (`tierMap` since #846,
proposed `owner` from the now-closed #1118). #1147 moves those Sutando
extensions to `$SUTANDO_WORKSPACE/state/discord-config.json` — Sutando's
owned territory, no plugin-schema conflict, no Claude-Code edit-policy prompt.

Two distinct consumers MUST resolve owner identity the same way:
  - `src/discord-bridge.py:_poll_proactive` (live bridge)
  - `src/dm-result.py:_resolve_owner_id` (fallback DM delivery)

This module is the single source of truth they both call into. The drift
class that bit us with #846's tierMap (one site got the read, the other
didn't) is fixed by funneling both through `resolve_owner_id` here.

Resolution order (config-driven; returns None if exhausted):
  1. SUTANDO_DM_OWNER_ID env var (operator override)
  2. discord-config.json["owner"]                       — Sutando, this file
  3. discord-config.json["tierMap"][uid] == "owner"     — Sutando, this file
  4. access.json["owner"]                                — legacy compat (#1118 WIP)
  5. access.json["tierMap"][uid] == "owner"              — legacy compat (#846)

On None, callers walk `allowFrom` with their own bot-filter (I/O-bearing
in both call sites — discord.py async vs sync REST in dm-result.py — so
the helper deliberately stays pure-Python).
