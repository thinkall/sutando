remote-gateway-bridge.py — generic client that bridges a REMOTE task gateway to the
local Sutando file queue, so the local core processes remote tasks unchanged.

This is the OPEN, provider-agnostic half of the "agent as a service" design: a
gateway service holds the platform connection and
exposes a tiny HTTP protocol; this client pulls *your* tasks down into the local
`tasks/` queue and pushes results back up. No provider-specific logic lives here
— that's the gateway's job.

Full spec: docs/remote-gateway-protocol.md

  Protocol (versioned, Bearer-auth):
  GET  {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/tasks?wait=<sec>
       → 200 {"tasks": [ {<task fields...>}, ... ]}   (long-poll; [] on timeout)
  POST {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/tasks/<task-id>/ack
       → body {"id": "<task-id>"}  → 200 on accepted
  POST {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/results
       → body {"id": "<task-id>", "body": "<result text>"}  → 200 on accepted
  POST {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/heartbeat
       → body {"client": "...", "inflight": N, ...}  → 200 on accepted

Each task object uses the same schema Sutando's other bridges write, so this
client just serializes it to `tasks/task-<id>.txt` and the core handles it like
any Discord/Telegram/Slack task. When `results/task-<id>.txt` appears, its body
is POSTed back and the result file is archived. Ack/heartbeat are best-effort:
if an older gateway returns 404/405, the client keeps working against the
original pull/result protocol.

Config (env / .env):
  REMOTE_TASK_TOKEN      the onboarding string — the ONLY required setting
                        (combined "https://<gateway>|<secret>" or a bare secret)
  REMOTE_TASK_URL        gateway base URL (only needed with a bare secret)
  REMOTE_TASK_URL/_TOKEN  legacy aliases
  REMOTE_TASK_PROVIDER  label used for the task `source:` field (default "remote")
  REMOTE_TASK_CHANNEL_DIR  name of this instance's config dir under
                        $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/ (default "ag2space") —
                        selects which .env fallback and access.json a bridge
                        instance reads, so a second instance (e.g. a dev
                        homeserver's "dev-ag2space") cannot inherit prod's
                        credentials or tier map. Env-only by necessity: the
                        .env file cannot name its own directory.
  REMOTE_TASK_POLL_WAIT long-poll seconds (default 25)
  REMOTE_OUTBOUND_SCAN_S outbound worker scan period seconds (default 1.0)

Stdlib only (urllib) — no new dependencies.

    `connect` writes the relay token to the channel .env, but not every launcher
    gets it into the process environment. The desktop-spawned core is the case
    that matters: its supervisor spawns the core (and the gateway window) with a
    fixed env whitelist, and the window sources the .env only once at start — so
    if connect writes the token after that (or the export step is skipped), the
    bridge sees an empty token and never connects (every new desktop-only user
    can reproduce this). Read the file directly so the bridge connects regardless
    of who launched it, and so a bridge already looping when connect wrote the
    token picks it up on its next start.

    Returns (token, url). A combined url|secret token embeds the URL (split
    downstream by _parse_onboarding_token), but a split-layout file (bare token +
    separate REMOTE_TASK_URL) does not — so the file's REMOTE_TASK_URL is returned
    alongside for the caller to feed into the URL chain. Returns ("", "") when no
    candidate file holds a token.

    Candidates, in order:
      1. AG2_DEVICE_ENV — the absolute path the desktop launcher (launch-sutando.sh)
         lays into the gateway window, pointing straight at the file connect wrote;
         the ONLY one that reaches the bridge in the desktop-spawned case.
      2. $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/ag2space/.env — for non-desktop launchers that
         do export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR into the bridge's environment.
    We deliberately do NOT guess ~/.claude: a bare-home guess is the one path that
    could silently pick up a token from an UNRELATED/old install and connect as the
    WRONG identity (reinstall, account switch, leftover config). Both real launchers
    are covered above; the bare-home guess only adds a footgun.

    and saw no effect, exactly the failure #2638 fixed for discord/slack/telegram

    Reuses the shared core policy `channel_token.token_from_vault` rather than

    sparrow ships standalone (`pyproject.toml`), so the monorepo `src/` may be
