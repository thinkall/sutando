# discord-bridge.py module-load has two side effects that fail in clean CI:
#   1. `import discord` + `discord.Intents.default()` + `discord.Client(...)`
#      — discord.py isn't installed on Ubuntu CI runners.
#   2. Reads DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN from $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/discord/.env and
#      `exit(1)` if missing — that path doesn't exist in CI.
#
# Bypass both so the test can reach `_chunk_for_discord` (pure string ops,
# no discord runtime dependency). Locally with the real discord installed
# and a real token, both bypasses no-op.
