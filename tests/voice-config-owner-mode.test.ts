// Unit tests for resolveOwnerMode (src/voice-config.ts) — the fail-closed
// owner-mode resolver for discord-voice (issue #1016, PR #1017 review fix).
//
// The discord-voice config is raw JSON spread into VoiceConfig, so a
// hand-edited file can carry a non-boolean owner_mode (string "false", null,
// a number, a typo). A loose `?? false` / truthy check would treat the STRING
// "false" as truthy and grant owner tier to every speaker — a trust-boundary
// bug. resolveOwnerMode must grant ONLY on the boolean literal `true`, and
// must preserve channel-over-skill precedence (a channel-explicit `false`
// overrides a skill-default `true`).
