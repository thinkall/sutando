/**
 * Voice agent tuned-prompt configuration — step 5a-1 of the interaction-planes
 * refactor (LiveAgentRuntime extraction, slice 1).
 *
 * PURE MOVE from voice-agent.ts: the greeting factory and the system-
 * instruction factory, verbatim. voice-agent.ts executes main() at module
 * load, so these tuned strings were untestable in place; here they are
 * importable, which upgrades the step-5 behavior anchors from source-hash
 * tripwires to real string snapshots.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md rule: prompts are tuned through testing and must be preserved
 * exactly. Every string in this module moved byte-for-byte; the only changes
 * are the injection seams:
 *   - module-level state of voice-agent.ts (mode resolver, meeting flag,
 *     session gates) arrives via VoiceConfigContext;
 *   - env-dependent reads (stand identity, voice context, repo URL) run
 *     verbatim by default, with test-only overrides so anchors can snapshot
 *     deterministic full strings.
