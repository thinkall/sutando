# Catchup

Reconstruct "what was happening before this session started" by reading everything Sutando persists across restarts. Designed to run as the **first** action of a fresh Sutando session, so the conversation buffer carries context before the user types anything.

This is the **recall half** of [#1032](https://github.com/sonichi/sutando/issues/1032) (episodic event memory). The capture half — wiring `event_log.py` into every lifecycle point — is the other half of that issue and remains a separate followup. Catchup ships now because almost all the recoverable signal is already on disk; it just needs to be assembled in one place.

**Usage**: `/catchup-after-startup`

ARGUMENTS: $ARGUMENTS

Optional first arg is an hour window for time-bounded sections (default 3). `/catchup-after-startup 12` widens to the last 12h.

## What it pulls together

1. **Last session checkpoint** — `session-state.md` (written by `src/session-handoff.sh` on context compaction)
2. **Open PRs** — `gh pr list --author liususan091219 --state open`
3. **In-flight tasks** — `workspace/tasks/task-*.txt`
4. **Recent results** — `workspace/results/` mtime within window
5. **Pending questions** — `pending-questions.md` tail
6. **Recent voice / phone / discord activity** — last N h from `data/conversation.sqlite` (voice + phone + discord_voice tables, post-#1051 schema)
7. **Recent chat** — `logs/conversation.log` last N h
8. **Recent commits** — `git log --all --since=Nh`
9. **build_log.md tail** — most recent prose entries from the proactive loop
10. **Health** — `health-check.py` one-liner

Sections that come up empty print a short "(none)" rather than getting dropped, so it's obvious whether nothing happened vs whether the lookup failed.

## Steps

1. Run `bash scripts/catchup-after-startup.sh [hours]`. Defaults to a 3-hour window via `CATCHUP_HOURS=3`.
2. Read the output into the conversation context. Do NOT discard sections silently — they shape decisions made next (which PR to push, which task is stale, which channel the conversation was in).
3. If the user's first prompt references something the catchup briefing doesn't cover (e.g. "what happened yesterday"), widen the window: `/catchup-after-startup 24` and re-read.
4. Cite specific recovered items as the basis for the next action (e.g. "Per the briefing, PR #1051 is open with a review from qingyun — addressing first.").

## Setup (one-time, recommended)

Catchup reads `session-state.md` to learn what the previous session was doing at the moment it ended. Out of the box, that file is written **only** by the `PreCompact` hook in `src/session-handoff.sh` — so if the previous session exited via ⌘Q (or crashed) without a compaction in between, the file is stale: it reflects the last compact, not the last close. The most-recent N-minute window is then invisible to the next session's catchup.

Closing that gap = adding a **SessionEnd** hook that fires the same `session-handoff.sh`. After install, `session-state.md` always reflects the latest close (compact OR clean exit), and catchup gets a freshest possible briefing.

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/catchup-after-startup/scripts/install-hook.sh
```

The installer is idempotent — safe to re-run. It edits `~/.claude/settings.json` and adds:

```json
"SessionEnd": [{
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bash \"${SUTANDO_REPO_DIR:-$HOME/Desktop/sutando}/src/session-handoff.sh\" \"${TRANSCRIPT_PATH:-}\""
  }]
}]
```

Requires `SUTANDO_REPO_DIR` env or a checkout at `~/Desktop/sutando` (the same convention `session-handoff.sh` uses for auto-detect).

**Without the hook** catchup still works — you just lose the last few minutes of the previous session's narrative when that session ended outside a compact. The rest (open PRs, in-flight tasks, sqlite, conversation.log, build_log) is real-time persisted and recovers regardless.

## Wiring for auto-invocation (operator-side, NOT in this PR)

The skill ships as the slash command only. **Auto-firing on every fresh session is the operator's choice** — this PR doesn't modify any loop or hook to call `/catchup-after-startup` for you. Wire it yourself wherever your proactive-loop / startup-orchestrator skill defines its on-activation block. Sample snippet for a personal proactive-loop SKILL.md:

```markdown
## Session-start catchup (FIRST action of a fresh session)

If this is the first proactive-loop pass after a fresh session start
(cold start, no prior context about what was happening), run
`/catchup-after-startup` BEFORE anything else. Read the briefing into
context, then proceed with the normal loop. Skip on subsequent passes
within the same session.
```

Also useful to invoke manually after a `/pull-and-restart` (services restart but the conversation buffer is the same) or after a context compaction (layer the briefing onto the new compacted context).

## Dependency note: sqlite section requires #1051's per-surface schema

The voice/phone/discord activity section queries `voice` / `phone` / `discord_voice` tables — introduced in [sonichi/sutando#1051](https://github.com/sonichi/sutando/pull/1051). On a db that pre-dates #1051, the section prints "(sqlite query failed — db schema may pre-date #1051)" and the other 9 sections still work. If #1056 lands first, that section will be empty until #1051 merges; the rest of the briefing is unaffected.

## What it does NOT recover

- **In-flight reasoning that never hit disk** during the previous session ("I was about to do X but hadn't said it yet"). Out of scope without a finer-grained checkpoint mechanism. Mitigated by the SessionEnd hook (separate followup) which forces a session-handoff snapshot on clean exit, not just PreCompact.
- **The model's working memory / vibe / rapport.** Catchup gives data, not feel.
- **Events from before the time window.** Widen with `/catchup-after-startup 24` or `/catchup-after-startup 168` (a week).

Both mitigations are tracked under #1032's wider scope.
