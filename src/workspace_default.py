"""Canonical workspace-directory resolution for Sutando services.

All runtime artifacts (tasks/, results/, state/, data/, build_log.md, ...) live
under the workspace dir. Post-v0.8 (#1440), components MUST resolve via the M0
helper (`scripts/sutando-config.sh workspace` from shell, or
`from src.sutando_config import resolve_workspace` from Python) which reads
`sutando.config.local.json` (per-clone, gitignored) and defaults to
`<repo>/workspace/`.

`$SUTANDO_WORKSPACE` is no longer honored for workspace resolution as of v0.8;
if set, it is still detected to fire a one-time deprecation warning and trigger
one-time auto-migration via per-source sentinels (PR #1478), but the resolver
ignores its value. The ad-hoc no-config-no-repo-root last-ditch fallback is
`~/sutando-workspace/` (was `~/.sutando/workspace/` pre-v0.8 — namespace
retired per Mini opinion-requested 2026-06-06).

This module is the historic Python wrapper; new code should call
`src.sutando_config.resolve_workspace` directly. The `default_workspace_dir`
function is retained for tests only — it is no longer the production default.

Historic anti-pattern: bridges fell back to `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent`
which resolved to the repo root, polluting `git status` with runtime artifacts
on bare-shell launches that forgot to set the env. Worse, when invoked from an
app-bundled `src/` symlink, it walked into the bundle and stranded owner DMs
(tasks landed in bundle-tasks/ while the watcher polled workspace-tasks/).

    workspaces have stragglers in the in-repo location.

    Different trigger than `_migrate_from_legacy`: that one fires only when
    `$SUTANDO_WORKSPACE` is UNSET (legacy install upgrading to the new default).
    THIS one fires when the env IS set, BUT the in-repo `notes/` dir (which
    code used to write to before the workspace contract) still contains files
    that aren't under `<workspace>/notes/`. The trigger condition is
    "workspace and in-repo location are different, AND in-repo has notes."

    Scope: top-level `.md`/`.txt` files only. Subdirectories (e.g.
    `notes/projects/`, `notes/media/`) are intentionally NOT migrated —
    workspace notes are flat by current convention. If/when nested notes
    become supported, this migrator grows a `recursive=True` flag rather
    than silently changing posture. Owner's notes layout (2026-05-16) is
    flat; this matches.

    Symmetric to `_migrate_from_legacy`'s posture: non-destructive on collision
    (skip the file if it already exists at the workspace location), logs each
    moved file to stderr, idempotent (second run finds in-repo empty and
