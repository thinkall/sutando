# Built-in tools (capability catalog)

Reference for the bash/CLI tools every Sutando session can call directly. Linked from `CLAUDE.md` to keep the per-session context budget small — open this file when you need to know what's available rather than carrying it on every turn.

**Voice tool sounds** — browser voice sessions keep tool activity visual-only by
default. Idle, connecting, disconnected, and active web UI tabs do not synthesize
tool tones unless audio cues are explicitly enabled for a diagnostic session.

**Calendar** — read Google Calendar events via `gws calendar`:
```bash
gws calendar +agenda --today            # today's events (table format by default)
gws calendar +agenda --week              # this week
gws calendar +agenda --days 7 --format json   # next 7 days, JSON for parsing
```

**Screen capture** — see what's on the user's screen. The screen-capture server runs on port 7845 (started by `src/startup.sh`). Every capture route requires the startup token in `X-Sutando-Capture-Token` — without it the server answers `403 {"status":"error","error":"forbidden"}`:
```bash
TOKEN="$(cat ~/.config/sutando/screen-capture-token)"
curl -s -H "X-Sutando-Capture-Token: $TOKEN" http://localhost:7845/capture \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["path"])'
# Multi-display: add ?all=true to capture every display, or ?display=N for a specific one.
# /capture-video takes the same header — it is the other capture route, gated identically.
```
Then use the Read tool on the returned path to view the screenshot. Use this for any screen-related question: "what am I looking at", "help me with this", "what's on my screen", etc.

A `forbidden` response means the header was missing or stale, **not** that capture is unavailable — re-read the token file rather than restarting the server.

`/capture` returns the display's native resolution — on a Retina screen that is
megabyte-class per frame. Frames entering a live voice session (the Watch/vision
stream, pull or push) are bounded first: anything over 200 KB is resampled to a
1280 px long edge and re-encoded as JPEG q60, measured at ~2.5 MB → ~236 KB on a
3024×1964 display. Frames share one websocket with realtime audio, so an
unbounded frame delays speech, not just vision. Reading a captured file from disk
is unaffected — the bound applies only on the way into a session.

**Notes** — the user's second brain. Save and retrieve notes:
- Save: write to `notes/{slug}.md` with a descriptive filename
- Retrieve: search notes with `Glob("notes/**/*.md")` or `Grep` for content
- Format: each note has a YAML frontmatter with `title`, `date`, `tags` (list), then the content
- Use for: "remember this", "take a note", "save this for later", research summaries, ideas, bookmarks
- Example:
```markdown
---
title: Project idea — voice-controlled home automation
date: 2026-03-16
tags: [ideas, projects, voice]
---
Content here...
```

**Email (Gmail)** — use the `gws-gmail` skill (OAuth, no app password needed):
```bash
gws gmail +send --to "to@x.com" --subject "subj" --body "body"
gws gmail +triage                               # unread inbox summary
gws gmail +read <messageId>                     # read a message
gws gmail users messages list --params 'q=keyword'  # search
```

**Signatures are never auto-inserted — append one yourself.** Gmail attaches the configured signature in its *composer*, so anything that writes a message some other way (the Gmail API, an IMAP `APPEND`-created draft) produces mail with no signature, and no Gmail setting changes that. When drafting or sending on the owner's behalf, append their signature to the body yourself — plain text plus an HTML alternative, so links render in both parts.

**Finding a specific email** — when the obvious query fails, invoke `/email-find <description>`. Broad-before-narrow playbook (full-inbox scan → partner-domain fanout → thread re-walk) that refuses to give up after one or two failed queries. See `skills/email-find/SKILL.md` for the workflow and rules around subject-mismatch + `get_thread` truncation. Per-user partner-domain mappings live in your own memory (the skill describes the file format).

**Contacts** — look up people by name or email:
```bash
python3 $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/macos-tools/scripts/contacts.py search "Bob"   # find by name
```
Use before sending email to resolve "email Bob" → actual email address. Returns name, emails, phones.

**Google Contacts — writable in practice, but NOT via a contract Google supports.** The entry above
is macOS Contacts and is lookup-only. It is not the only contacts path: on 2026-09-04 an agent that
had been told no write path existed created a contact on a live Google account using **only the Gmail
app password already held for IMAP/SMTP** — `PROPFIND` returned 207, `PUT` of a vCard returned 201,
and a `GET` read it back (#3903).

**Read that as an observation, not as Google's credential contract.** Google's own CardDAV
documentation specifies OAuth 2.0 with a registered application, tells clients to begin at
`https://www.googleapis.com/.well-known/carddav` rather than hardcoding a discovered URI, and
documents `POST` of a vCard as the insert operation (`PUT` being the update path). The app-password
Basic-auth flow below matches none of that. It is legacy behaviour that happened to work once, on one
account, and Google can withdraw it without notice.

So: **probe before you rely on it, and never present it to the owner as a supported integration.**

```bash
# 1. DISCOVER — do not hardcode the principal URL; Google says it can change.
curl -su "$USER_EMAIL:$APP_PASSWORD" -X PROPFIND \
     https://www.googleapis.com/.well-known/carddav -H 'Depth: 0'
# 2. PROBE the collection you discovered. 207 = this legacy path is still open for this account;
#    401/403 = it is not — stop, and say so, rather than assuming the 2026-09-04 result still holds.
BASE="<collection URL from step 1>"     # observed then: .../carddav/v1/principals/$USER_EMAIL/lists/default/
curl -su "$USER_EMAIL:$APP_PASSWORD" -X PROPFIND "$BASE" -H 'Depth: 1'
# 3. CREATE. Google documents POST for insert; PUT with `If-None-Match: *` is what was observed to
#    work, and is create-only, so a retry cannot silently overwrite an existing card.
curl -su "$USER_EMAIL:$APP_PASSWORD" -X PUT "$BASE<uid>.vcf" \
     -H 'Content-Type: text/vcard; charset=utf-8' -H 'If-None-Match: *' \
     --data-binary @contact.vcf
curl -su "$USER_EMAIL:$APP_PASSWORD" "$BASE<uid>.vcf"                      # read it back
```

Get the app password from the vault (`secret-vault.py get <KEY>`); never inline it. If the probe in
step 2 fails, the supported route is OAuth 2.0 against the People API or CardDAV with a registered
client — build that rather than retrying Basic auth with the owner's secret.

**⚠ The general rule this entry exists to teach: a credential's reach is not the name of the tool you
got it for.** A Google app password is accepted by IMAP and SMTP, and — as above — was accepted by
CardDAV. Before telling the owner "I have no way to do X", spend one probe on what your *held
credentials* actually reach, rather than answering from what this catalog happens to list. Answering
from the catalog is how a capability that already existed gets reported as missing. The probe is also
what keeps the answer honest in the other direction: it distinguishes "this works" from "this worked
once for someone else."

**iMessage** — send and read iMessages:
```bash
imsg send --to "+14155551234" --text "Hello!"    # send message
imsg chats                                        # list recent chats
imsg messages --chat "+14155551234" --limit 10    # read messages
```
Always confirm message content with user before sending.

**WhatsApp** — send messages via WhatsApp (unpaired? use the guided connect flow — `skills/whatsapp/scripts/guided_connect.py`, pairing from chat, no terminal; full reference in `skills/whatsapp/SKILL.md`):
```bash
wacli send text --to "+14155551234" --message "Hello!"
wacli chats list --limit 20
wacli messages search "keyword" --limit 10
```
Optional `.env`: `WACLI_DEVICE_LABEL`, `WACLI_DEVICE_PLATFORM` (label shown in WhatsApp → Linked Devices on the user's phone).

**X (Twitter)** — post, search, read, and monitor:
```bash
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py post "Tweet text"                       # post
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py post "With video" --media /path/to.mp4  # with media
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py search "query"                          # search recent
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py read 123456789                          # read tweet
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py mentions                                # recent @mentions
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py timeline                                # YOUR tweets (OAuth1)
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py user-timeline <handle>                  # ANOTHER account (bearer)
python3 skills/x-twitter/x-post.py engagement 123456789                    # likes/rt/views
```
`post`/`mentions`/`timeline` need X_API_KEY, X_API_SECRET, X_ACCESS_TOKEN, X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET.
`search`/`read`/`user-timeline` run on X_BEARER_TOKEN alone. `timeline` resolves `users/me` and is
OAuth1-only; `user-timeline` reads the same endpoint by handle over bearer, so it works where
`timeline` cannot. Its `--limit` is 5..100 (`search`'s is 10..100 — different endpoints).
Always confirm post content with user before publishing.

**Reminders** — read/write macOS Reminders (to-do list):
```bash
python3 $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/macos-tools/scripts/reminders.py list             # incomplete reminders
python3 $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/macos-tools/scripts/reminders.py add "Call Bob"    # add reminder
python3 $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/macos-tools/scripts/reminders.py add "Fix bug" "2026-03-17"  # with due date
python3 $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/macos-tools/scripts/reminders.py complete "Call Bob"  # mark done
```
Use for "add a reminder", "what's on my todo list", "remind me to...", "mark X as done".

**macOS GUI control** — click, type, scroll, press keys in any Mac app via `macos-use` MCP skill. Works in non-interactive mode (which is how the proactive loop runs), unlike Claude's built-in computer-use. Accessibility-tree based — no screenshots leave the machine.

Tools (after `bash skills/macos-use/scripts/build.sh && bash skills/macos-use/scripts/install-mcp.sh`):
- `mcp__macos-use__open_application_and_traverse` — open/activate an app, return its a11y tree
- `mcp__macos-use__click_and_traverse` — click at coordinates in a target PID
- `mcp__macos-use__type_and_traverse` — type text into the focused element
- `mcp__macos-use__press_key_and_traverse` — press a named key (Return, Tab, arrows, ...)
- `mcp__macos-use__scroll_and_traverse` — scroll in a direction
- `mcp__macos-use__refresh_traversal` — re-read the a11y tree without acting

Prefer this for any "open X and do Y" task in a native app (Zoom join, Mail compose, Finder navigation). For web pages, prefer Browser automation (below). Full doc in `skills/macos-use/SKILL.md`.

**Browser automation** — navigate, read, fill forms, screenshot web pages:

In the ChatGPT/Codex desktop app, prefer its Browser or Chrome plugin. Those
desktop browser backends are not available to a plain Codex CLI core, even
when the plugin skill is installed. For the Codex CLI core, use Sutando's
persistent Playwright profile below.

**Default: navigate within the active tab when the next URL has the same origin (scheme + host + port) as the current tab.** Only spawn a new tab for cross-origin navigation, when an existing tab is the only context that holds the relevant state (a logged-in session, a long-running app), or when the user explicitly asks for a new tab. `localhost:7844` and `localhost:8080` are DIFFERENT origins — same hostname, but different ports → different services → don't share a tab. This keeps the browser tab count bounded during multi-step flows — without it, every `mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate` opens a fresh tab and the user ends up with dozens of half-used tabs after a research session.

Codex CLI and non-interactive use: `src/browser.mjs` uses a dedicated persistent
Chrome profile at `<workspace>/data/browser-profile`. Run setup once, sign in to
the sites Sutando may operate, and close the setup window. Later commands reuse
those sessions without accessing the user's everyday Chrome profile:
```bash
node src/browser.mjs setup                                      # one-time visible sign-in
node src/browser.mjs profile                                    # show profile location
node src/browser.mjs "https://example.com"                    # get page text
node src/browser.mjs "https://example.com" screenshot         # full-page screenshot → path
node src/browser.mjs "https://example.com" "fill:#email:me@x.com" "click:#submit"  # fill + click
node src/browser.mjs "https://example.com" --headed           # watch automation live
node src/browser.mjs "https://example.com" screenshot --timeout=60000  # override the 45s command limit
```
Actions: `text`, `screenshot`, `pdf`, `html`, `click:<selector>`, `fill:<selector>:<value>`, `select:<selector>:<value>`, `wait:<ms>`.
Non-interactive commands are bounded to 45 seconds by default; `--timeout` may
raise that command-level limit to at most 300,000 ms. Navigation uses the
remaining command budget, and declared `wait:` actions must fit the budget or
the command fails before launching with guidance to pass a larger `--timeout`.
Up to five seconds of the limit is reserved for cleanup. Normal completion,
errors, timeouts, `SIGINT`, and `SIGTERM` all close the page, context, and browser
before the command exits. A second signal during cleanup restores Node's normal
immediate termination behavior instead of being swallowed.

**File search (Spotlight)** — find any file on the Mac:
```bash
mdfind "quarterly report"                    # search by content or filename
mdfind -name "resume.pdf"                    # search by filename only
mdfind "kMDItemKind == 'PDF'" -onlyin ~/Documents  # by file type in a folder
```

**Meeting join** — join Zoom or Google Meet with computer audio:
```bash
npx tsx -e "import 'dotenv/config'; import { joinZoomTool } from './skills/zoom/tools.ts'; joinZoomTool.execute({}, null).then(r => console.log(JSON.stringify(r)))"
npx tsx -e "import 'dotenv/config'; import { joinGmeetTool } from './src/inline-tools.ts'; joinGmeetTool.execute({ meetingCode: 'abc-defg-hij' }, null).then(r => console.log(JSON.stringify(r)))"
npx tsx -e "import 'dotenv/config'; import { summonTool } from './skills/zoom/tools.ts'; summonTool.execute({}, null).then(r => console.log(JSON.stringify(r)))"
```
- `joinZoomTool` — Zoom desktop app + computer audio (no screen share)
- `joinGmeetTool` — Chrome browser + computer audio + camera off
- `summonTool` — Zoom + screen share + computer audio

**Conversational phone calls** — use the `/phone-conversation` skill:
- Outbound calls, meeting dial-in (Zoom/Google Meet), concurrent calls
- Auto-summary when calls/meetings end
- Look up contacts and calendar for numbers/PINs before calling
- The voice agent delegates "call X" and "join my meeting" requests to core via `work`

**Claude Code history import** — `/import-claude-context` (`skills/import-claude-context/`): index, extract and haiku-summarise the owner's stock `~/.claude/projects` transcripts into core memory (`claude_import.md` + a budget-guarded `MEMORY.md` row), `notes/claude-import/` and People payloads. Everything is staged first (`finalize.py --stage`, the default) and shown to the owner as a digest in their DM; it lands only when they reply "bring it in" (`--commit`), "bring in <slug>" for one project, or is dropped with "forget <slug>" (`--discard`). Sessions the summariser flags as personal are held back — the digest shows only their date and a generic reason, and "include <date>" / "hold <date>" / "forget <date>" are the owner's call; people the store already has get an appended section and merged identifiers, never a replaced dossier or a duplicate. Read-only on `~/.claude`, conversation text only (no tool I/O), secrets redacted before disk; the owner's transcripts are processed by Anthropic's Claude API (the haiku subagents), the provider the Sutando already runs on, which does not train on them. Nothing is uploaded to AG2 Space except the people the owner approves in the digest, which are saved to their People store, and nothing else leaves the machine without `--cloud`. Only after the onboarding Import button or an explicit "import my Claude history"; `--counts-only`/`--dry-run` for counts, `--new` to pick up new sessions, `--forget <slug>` (a known slug or a unique part of one — never a path) to undo one project: its note, roll-up, summaries, approved snapshot and its citations in the approved People export. The memory file and `overview.md` are rebuilt from per-project approved snapshots (`data/claude-import/approved/<slug>.json`), so committing one project never lands another's unreviewed roll-up — the digest names it "changed since approval — bring in <slug> to refresh".

**Local skills** — check `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/` for user-installed skills (video processing, etc.). Always prefer a local skill over raw commands when one exists for the task.

**Trusted capability catalog** — discover, inspect, install, and update skills
from the allowlisted repositories declared in
`skills/trusted-capabilities/manifest.json`:
```bash
C=skills/trusted-capabilities/scripts/catalog.py
python3 "$C" sources
python3 "$C" search browser
python3 "$C" inspect anthropic-skills skills/skill-creator
python3 "$C" install anthropic-skills skills/skill-creator        # dry run
# Review the dry-run output, then copy its exact commit into the write:
python3 "$C" install anthropic-skills skills/skill-creator --commit <40-char-sha> --yes
python3 "$C" update skill-creator                                 # dry run
python3 "$C" update skill-creator --commit <40-char-sha> --yes
```
Skill installs are pinned to an upstream commit and record provenance for later
updates. Tool repositories can be searched and inspected but are
install-disabled because their setup and permissions are source-specific.

**App launcher** — open an app on the user's visible desktop:
```bash
# Windows: use the registered display name; success requires verified foreground focus.
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/open-app.ps1 "Paint"
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/open-app.ps1 "Microsoft Store"

# macOS
open -a "Safari"
open -a "Slack"
open "https://github.com"           # open URL in default browser
```
Voice and phone can use `switch_app` on macOS and Windows. The Windows CLI and
inline tool share `src/windows-app-launcher.ps1`; bundled services ship the same
backend beside their JavaScript artifacts.

Windows matches registered app IDs or exact executable paths, never window-title
substrings. It reuses an existing window (restoring it if minimized) or launches
once, then verifies the intended app actually owns the foreground. An already
foreground app is left alone; otherwise the first matching window is selected,
not a particular document or profile. Shortcuts whose identity cannot be resolved
fail rather than guessing from their display name.

An interactive desktop is required. Windows may refuse foreground activation,
especially when the agent runs in the background; the tool reports that refusal
and asks the user to select the app from the taskbar. Merely launching a process
or making a window visible is not success.

**Context drop + shortcuts** — the Sutando menu bar app (`src/Sutando/`) provides global hotkeys. **Live config**: `~/.config/sutando/hotkeys.json` (per-user override) with defaults registered in `src/Sutando/main.swift:944` (`registerHotKey()` action list). When the user asks "what hotkeys do I have", read those sources — don't quote a static list from this file (it would drift behind the actual registration).

The menu-bar app is optional and is not built or launched by the headless core's `startup.sh`; compile and launch the app separately, including `bash skills/context-drop/build.sh` when enabling context-drop. Check `tasks/` for dropped context.

## Model switch (no CLI needed)

```bash
bash scripts/switch-model.sh claude-opus-5          # alias (opus/sonnet/haiku/fable/default) or a claude-* id, optional [1m]
bash scripts/switch-model.sh fable --dry-run        # prints what it would do, changes nothing
bash scripts/switch-model.sh opus --confirm         # a warm core asks to confirm; this answers it (owner instruction)
```

Types `/model <name>` into the live `sutando-core` pane through the shared sender, waits for the CLI
to accept it, and only then records `<workspace>/state/model-switch.json` (with the previous model).
A warm core asks to confirm first; `--confirm` (on an owner instruction) answers it, otherwise the
dialog is cancelled. Refuses when the input box carries text or on a Codex runtime. It never writes
`settings.json`: Claude Code's `/model` persists the choice itself. Exit 2 = name refused; 3 = no live
pane; 4 = Codex runtime; 5 = input box busy; 6 = confirm dialog not confirmed; 8 = no acceptance seen.
The capability lives in `skills/model-switch/`.
